Project: Design a simple Algorithmic trading strategy

The project is a simple trading strategy that takes input as script which defines a company name and outputs the stock price, lows, highs, date and time with respect
to the stock name provided. Here I used API from Alpha Vantage to get data of a stock. The project is distributed among 3 parts namely getting data, choosing only
the required factors and desplaying the desired output. Output shows whether to buy, sell or do nothing to the stock on the given time. I used python 3.9 for the 
project along with libraries pandas, numpy, etc. and code was written in jupyter notebook. 

How to run the code: Only required tech stack is Jupyter notebook and API.
